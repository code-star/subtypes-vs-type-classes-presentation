Type classes vs Sub-typing and type-class support in cats

Many people uses sub-typing/inheriance because they are more familiar with it, but would be better
of using type-classes

Type class 
Idea:Defines a set of functions that can have different implementations depending on the type of data.

Sub class/Sub type
Idea: Define a general behavior and make it more specialized for special instances (inheritance).



Advantages with type-classes over sub-types

1. Less Classes coupling, less messy dependencies.

2. More technical flexibility, properties like identity-function etc for free in many cases, 
sometimes the compiler can have problem understanding multiple link of inheritance,
are able to add a behavior to primitive or external types.

3. Library support that gives you a lot of code for free.
